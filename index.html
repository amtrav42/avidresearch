            <p>From story telling to map making, Avid Research provides a bridge between the sciences and the arts.
              We have worked on maps and stories from all over the world, and bring them here to share with you.
              Contact us for innovative and engaging ways to communicate, share and educate about your story!
              We are particularly proud of our “Illuminating the Night” map story created for GovHack 2018, communicating the Right to the Night data collected in Ballarat, Victoria.</p>
