            <p>Welcome to the stories about the maps!
              <br>
In May this year my parents, inspiring intrepid grey nomads that they are, flew over Lake Eyre whilst it was full of water. They saw a normally dry flat plain full of water and life, all from the sky. I was sufficiently jealous as to be inspired to make a map of this wonderful phenomena.
<br><br>Lakes in central Australia are one of my favorite misleading things. They’re always marked as blue on the map, implying water, possibly out of hope, possibly out of complete cartographic embarrassment about having miles and miles of “empty” map.
But they’re very rarely blue, they’re usually salt lakes and dry as a bone.
But this year it is actually different. Lake Eyre is full, there’s water, birds and life (and tourists), all because a long time ago it rained up in channel country, Queensland. The water slowly leaked across the continent, across states and filled up the lake bed.
One day I’ll get to see it, in the mean time I get to write about it and paint it!

Looking for your own Lake Eyre to keep? <br><br>This map looks fantastic on mugs and tote bags, check them out <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/amaltr42/works/39409551-lake-eyre?p=throw-pillow" target="_blank">here!</a>

Mum and dad just went there and flew over the lake, and I wanted to share!</p>
