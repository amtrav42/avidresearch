            My experiences with code haven’t been great. If the conditions aren’t right it’s an incredibly uncomfortable, frustrating and nigh on impossible thing to learn. It’s abstract, complex and multifaceted. It’s also unique to the individual doing the coding, so finding your way to learn is key.
            It’s taken 10 years, 4 attempts and I’ve finally found my groove.

          <h2>1. Rage Quit</h2>
          <p>
            I wasn’t exposed to code at school. I don’t think I was even really aware that it existed. Mid 2000’s tech wasn’t really a thing where I studied. I vaguely remember sitting in a computer room once or twice, but I don’t remember what we did. Possibly played Maths games. Mostly our tech was learning Word and Excel. Electronics was a big thing in my family, I knew how to take things apart, what resistors were, how to put them back together. That was the lense I saw computers through,  what they physically were when you went at them with a screwdriver.
            <br><br>
            The closest I saw to code was:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The green lines on the Matrix</li>
            <li>The boot up screen on my Laptop</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="noBigFirstLetter">
            Not a solid computational thinking platform to start from.
            <br><br>
            Then suddenly out of nowhere in my Science degree, Second Semester: First Year Statistics. I made the mistake of assuming this compulsory course would be about Statistics, possibly even teaching us about them. It was not. It was assumed we knew statistics from somewhere (I did not), it also assumed we knew about programming (I did not), and it was all about applying R to Statistics.
            <br><br>
            It was one of the most memorable times of my life when I sat in a room and felt like I was drowning in the air. I had no idea about any of the concepts being discussed or taught and had no idea where to start. It was a horrible feeling. I had no idea what the value of R was supposed to be, or how it was supposed to apply to my field of Geography.
            Somehow I passed the course. With a bit of head banging, tenacity and basic maths skills. I had some ability to type stuff in and make stuff happen, but I never fully understood how I’d managed it. I recently learned this is called programming by coincidence and is a long way from best practice.
            For someone who loved to learn this was not rewarding, the feeling of guessing and somehow being right but not being able to replicate the process.
            <br><br>
            After I passed the course I vowed never to touch R again and decided that it was a deeply unhelpful pointless program which made simple things complicated.
            It was never mentioned again through any of my degrees, so my somewhat unreasonable beliefs never got questioned.
            <br><br>

          <h2>2. Nope out</h2>
          <p>
            As a GIS Officer with a civil engineering company I was given a number of workflows to manage. I was convinced there was a way to automate these workflows, and experimented with a combination of visual programming and ArcPy (an ArcGIS specific Python package) to try and get that automation happening. There was no one around me who knew about this stuff and could help me. It was just me and some online documentation by people who never seemed to be wanting to do anything at all similar to what I wanted to do. It also seemed to have been written, quite reasonably, for people who had some basic programming knowledge.
            I was trying to create fairly complex workflows without any kind of understanding of how to design a program. Just dragging and dropping and typing and hoping for the best.
            Just lucky I never broke anything really. I could easily have applied the wrong clipping mask and killed my dataset.
            <br><br>
            I went to the ESRI developers conference in California as a result of a few confused ideas on my employers behalf. Once again I had that drowning feeling, although no where near so bad since there was no exam at the end of it all. The main things I learned during that conference was what Ruby was, largely by finding one of the handful of other women at the conference and being like “...Ummm excuse me, dumb quesion but...”.
            <br>
            I also learned about “drinking the kool-aid”. When I first got asked this I looked around deeply confused, “No, I’ve just been drinking the coffee”. I quickly learned that this was lingo for something I hadn’t seen in Australia before, but describes a deep passion for a company that you are using or working for. I learned stuff, just not really relevant stuff.
            <br><br>
            On coming back home I decided it was best to nope out of the whole thing. This wasn’t my jam, I didn’t know enough about the basic concepts and I didn’t have anyone who could help me answer my questions. I had too many unknown unknowns.
            Time to bow out gracefully.
            <br><br>

          <h2>3. Fizzle Quit(s)</h2>
          <p>
            Since then I have poked at learning to code a few times. I learnt a bit about Mathematica as part of the Wolfram Summer School, that’s where I got my first taste of machine learning, and I loved it. Sadly my computer at the time was a little on the cheap side, and the small side and did not love it and spent a lot of time with the fan whirring hating me. I could see the potential, was really excited by the potential and was supported at the camp. But when I got back home and into my teaching degree that I was doing at the time, it all fell by the wayside. #Fizzle
            <br><br>
            I met people during scientific expeditions using LaTeX and I was like, that’s so cool! Anyone using LaTeX just looked like a kind of cool edgy coder as far as I was concerned. I wanted to learn it, downloaded it and the cheat sheet, and never had any reason to use it, or a supervisor who could cope with me using it. Once again #Fizzle <br><br>
            Then last year I was introduced to Udemy and had a friend who wanted to learn C++ for coding in Unreal Engine. I was like, that’s cool, I wanna get on that train, we can code together. I decided to start by relearning Python, and then moving back into the Machine Learning that I’d done with Wolfram. I got a fair way, but then life intervened. I was working full time, had a side hustle and neither jobs needed me to code. I had no need and no clear project I wanted to work on. The courses are still there, and I will go back to them eventually, but till then...
            <br> #Fizzle.

          <h2>4. Today</h2>
          <p>
            Today I've been having a lot of success learning to code, and applying what I've learned. Why? Because things are different. <br> I have a lot of support (so much support!), useful resources and people I can ask questions. I’m learning to build websites, which is incredibly common and there’s no shortage of documentation. I’m listening to podcasts and watching videos and talking to people at Meetups. All of those elements were missing in my earlier experiments.
            I have no doubt that it is possible to teach yourself to code with no support, just with written manuals. However I didn’t know where to start and I didn’t know what to do when things go wrong. When I was at my formative stages at university a lot of the resources just weren’t accessible.
            <br><br>
            I suspect I felt the way a lot of people feel when they’re trying to learn how to knit from the internet or a book. It’s all well and good while you’re following the instructions, but you have no idea how to fix things when they go wrong, and they will go wrong.
            The keys to success have been (for me):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enthusiastic Support</li>
            <li>Resources available in my learning styles</li>
            <li>Real projects to work on (that I care about)</li>
            <li>Ability to ask questions of real people in person</li>
            <li>Immersing myself in the universe of code</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="noBigFirstLetter">
            Don’t give up people! Find the language, context and learning style that works for you. Then go out and conquer that world of code and programming!
